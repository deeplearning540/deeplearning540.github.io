Lesson 03: Clustering
*********************

Learning Objectives
===================

* Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning

* Unsupervised learning algorithms don’t need training

* Kmeans is a popular clustering algorithm.

* Kmeans struggles where one cluster exists within another, such as concentric circles.

* Spectral clustering is another technique which can overcome some of the limitations of Kmeans.

* Spectral clustering is much slower than Kmeans.

* As well as providing machine learning algorithms scikit learn also has functions to make example data



Content

This lesson is based on `Regression <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-novice-sklearn/04-clustering/index.html>`_ and will be shared as a video.

* nice quick notebook available `on kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/khotijahs1/k-means-clustering-of-iris-dataset>`_ that may be used as support
