Lesson 04: Classification Performance ROCs
******************************************

Learning Objectives
===================

* discuss true positive rate and false positive rate

* explain how a cut-off value (for kmeans classification) is used to produce a ROC curve

* assert that a ROC curve is an envelope produced for a fixed test set

* demo how to construct a ROC curve

* contrast the difference between adding individual points into a ROC plot and producing a ROC curve

* show `plot_roc_curve` in sklearn

* discuss extremes of a ROC curve


Content
=======

This lesson will be shared as a video.

* for learners: a stub notebook to get you started can be obtained from `the lesson04 repo <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson04/blob/main/lesson.ipynb>`_.
* for instructors: the video script is available `here <https://github.com/deeplearning540/deeplearning540.github.io/blob/main/source/lesson04/script.ipynb>`_.


Check your Learning
===================

The following questions serve as a help for learners to reflect on the content of the videos. Answer at least one question. At best you want to answer these questions as a team.

.. admonition:: Exercise 1

   The `ROC` acronym stands for

   1. Receiver Operator Curve
   2. Receiving Operates Curves
   3. Receiver Operating Characteristic
   4. Reception Occlusion Characteristic

   3. yes, ``Receiver Operating Characteristic``
   I made up the rest.

.. admonition:: Exercise 2

   Fill in the blanks!

   A k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) classifier can produce a probability when predicting the class label of an unseen sample ``x_q``. This can be achieved by counting class ``_______`` in the training set neighborhood of this query point.

   For a ``k=7`` neighborhood, the threshold to decide for any given class in this neighborhood is calculated as ``4/__``. In the same setting (``k=7``), let's assume we find ``5`` labels for class ``1`` and ``2`` labels for class ``0``. This means, that we get two probabilities, which are ``_____`` for class ``1`` and ``_____`` for class ``0``.

   A k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) classifier can produce a probability when predicting the class label of an unseen sample ``x_q``. This can be achieved by counting class ``frequencies`` in the training set neighborhood of this query point.

   For a ``k=7`` neighborhood, the threshold to decide for any given class in this neighborhood is calculated as ``4/7``. In the same setting (``k=7``), let's assume we find ``5`` labels for class ``1`` and ``2`` labels for class ``0``. This means, that we get two probabilities, which are ``5/7 = 0.7143`` for class ``1`` and ``2/7 = 0.2857`` for class ``0``.

Exercises
=========

For this lesson, please complete the following steps in order:

1. produce a ROC curve for the classifier you trained in `lesson03 </source/lesson03/content.rst>`_.

2. take another NN based classifier, e.g. `sklearn.neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier` or `sklearn.neighbors.NearestCentroid` and train it

3. make predictions on the test set with it and produce a ROC 

4. combine the 2 ROC curves in a plot and discuss which classifier is better!

Data sets
=========

* Data sets for clustering. Each of the following synthetic data sets contains several features `x1`, `x2`, ... and a `label` column which comprises (2 classes).

  * `clustering_data_00.csv <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson02/blob/main/data/clustering_data_00.csv>`_
  * `clustering_data_01.csv <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson02/blob/main/data/clustering_data_01.csv>`_
  * `clustering_data_02.csv <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson02/blob/main/data/clustering_data_02.csv>`_
  * `clustering_data_03.csv <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson02/blob/main/data/clustering_data_03.csv>`_
  * `clustering_data_04.csv <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson02/blob/main/data/clustering_data_04.csv>`_
  * `clustering_data_05.csv <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson02/blob/main/data/clustering_data_05.csv>`_
  * `clustering_data_06.csv <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson02/blob/main/data/clustering_data_06.csv>`_
  * `clustering_data_07.csv <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson02/blob/main/data/clustering_data_07.csv>`_

  * `clustering_data_09.csv <https://github.com/deeplearning540/lesson02/blob/main/data/clustering_data_09.csv>`_

* `iris plants <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data sets/toy_data set.html#iris-plants-dataset>`_ data set. Use the columns `petal_length` vs. `petal_width`. The class label is provided as the `target` column. To obtain the data frame from this data set do the following:

.. code-block:: python

  import pandas as pd
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  iris = load_iris()
  df = pd.DataFrame(data= np.c_[iris['data'], iris['target']],
                    columns= iris['feature_names'] + ['target'])
