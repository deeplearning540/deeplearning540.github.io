Lesson 03: Clustering For Classification
****************************************

Learning Objectives
===================

* remember how clustering works
* recognize that once clustering is trained/used, it can be used for classification
* Centroid Clustering is used only to save memory
* Apply clustering for classification
* execute a counting experiment to see which items have been properly categorized
* use accuracy, precision and recall to describe the classifiers performance



Content
=======

This lesson is based on `Clustering <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-novice-sklearn/04-clustering/index.html>`_ and will be shared as a video.

* nice quick notebook available `on kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/khotijahs1/k-means-clustering-of-iris-dataset>`_ that may be used as support

Exercises
=========

* cluster the `penguin dataset <https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins>`_ into 3 classes when looking at bill length vs flipper length; the data is available `here <https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/tree/master/inst/extdata>`_

* `sklearn based datasets <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html>`_:

  * https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#iris-plants-dataset into 3 classes when looking at petal_length vs. petal_width

  * https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html#sklearn.datasets.load_wine not sure yet which features to use
