*****************

The content below provides a high level overview on the content to teach.

.. Probably a bug in the deploy action (peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3): we
   can't use the folder name "lesson01". Must be something else, "lesson_01"
   works. "lesson01" works when building html locally, but the GH action build
   throws a 404 when accessing
   https://deeplearning540.github.io/lesson01/content.html . All other lessons,
   e.g. ".../lesson01/content.html" work just fine.
