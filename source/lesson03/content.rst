Lesson 03: From Clustering To Classification
********************************************

Learning Objectives
===================

* remember how clustering works
* recognize that once clustering is trained/used, it can be used for classification
* Centroid Clustering is used to save memory
* Apply clustering for classification
* execute a counting experiment to see which items have been properly categorized
* use accuracy, precision and recall to describe the classifiers performance
